Quickstart for creating a Roblox exploit with the C# WeAreDevs API
https://wearedevsapi.netlify.app/

*You can find the built/exported .exe in the "/release" folder

*WeAreDevs_API.dll must always be in the same folder as your built .exe file

*When sharing with friends, I would build in x86 release mode
